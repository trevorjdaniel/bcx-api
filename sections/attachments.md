Attachments
===========

Submitting files to Basecamp is a two step process:

1. Create the attachment, receive a token verifying the upload was successful ("Create attachment" endpoint)
2. Attach the file to a comment, message, or upload. See the following endpoints for attaching:
   * [Create uploads](https://github.com/basecamp/bcx-api/blob/master/sections/uploads.md)
   * [Create comments](https://github.com/basecamp/bcx-api/blob/master/sections/comments.md)
   * [Create messages](https://github.com/basecamp/bcx-api/blob/master/sections/messages.md)

Create attachment
-----------------

* `POST /attachments.json` uploads a file. The request body should be the
binary data of the attachment. Make sure to set the `Content-Type` and
`Content-Length` headers.

Once the upload is successful, you'll get a `200 OK` response, and we'll give
you a token back that you'll need to save locally to attach the file.

```json
{
  "token": "4f71ea23-134660425d1818169ecfdbaa43cfc07f4e33ef4c"
}
```

With `curl`, here's an example:

```
curl --data-binary @logo.png \
       -u user:pass \
       -H 'Content-Type: image/png' \
       -H 'User-Agent: Rapp (david@basecamp.com)' \
       https://basecamp.com/999999999/api/v1/attachments.json
```

*Note:* Uploading can take a while, if the file is big! Make sure to account for this in your implementation.

Get attachment
--------------

* `GET /projects/1/attachments/1.json` will return the specified attachment
 with file metadata, urls, and associated attachables (Uploads, Messages,
or Comments) with a `200 OK` response.

```json

  "id": 999008202,

  }
}
```

Get attachments
---------------

* `GET /projects/1/attachments.json` shows attachments for this
project with file metadata, urls, and associated attachables (Uploads, Messages,
or Comments) with a `200 OK` response.
* `GET /attachments.json` shows attachments for all projects.

If you need more information about what the attachment is attached to, you can
make another request to the `attachable`'s `url` value.

We will return 50 attachments per page. If the
result set has 50 attachments, it's your responsibility to check the next page
to see if there are any more attachments -- you do this by adding `?page=2` to the
query, then `?page=3` and so on.

It's also possible to change the order attachments are returned in with the `sort`
parameter. Attachments can be sorted by name, size and age using the parameter
values `az` and `za` for name, `biggest` and `smallest` for size, and `newest`
and `oldest` for age.  This can be combined with `page`, so to get the second
page of attachments sorted by oldest first, use
`/attachments.json?page=2&sort=oldest`.

The response to an attachments request looks like this:

Linked attachments like [Google Docs](https://basecamp.com/help/guides/projects/google-docs) don't have a `url` attribute and include additional attributes about the source.

Private attachments
-------------------

Attachments inherit the privacy of their containers. For example, an attachment on a private message is private. Making the message visible to clients will make all of its attachments visible to clients.
